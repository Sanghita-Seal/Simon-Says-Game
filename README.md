# Simon Says Game

A fun and interactive Simon Says memory game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The game challenges the player to repeat a sequence of colors and sounds that are shown to them. The sequence gets progressively longer as the player successfully repeats it, making the game more challenging.

## Game Features

- **Color Sequence**: The game generates a random sequence of colors.
- **Sound Feedback**: Each color is associated with a sound to help players remember the sequence.
- **Memory Challenge**: As players correctly repeat the sequence, the game adds a new color to the sequence.
- **Score Tracker**: The score increases each time the player successfully repeats the sequence.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when the player makes an incorrect move, and the score is reset.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the game, including buttons and divs for visual elements.
- **CSS**: Styling for the game, creating a visually appealing and interactive layout.
- **JavaScript**: Logic to handle the game flow, including sequence generation, user input, and game state.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. The game will start with a simple sequence of colors. The goal is to click the colors in the exact order shown.
3. After you successfully repeat the sequence, the game will add another color to the sequence, making it longer.
4. If you make a mistake, the game will end, and your score will be displayed.
